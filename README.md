## Join Us in Building the Ultimate Open-Source AI Geo Location Guesser

I'm calling all developers, ML engineers, AI enthusiasts, and open-source contributors:

Help us build a powerful, privacy-friendly, open-source **AI-based location prediction engine** — a true alternative to closed systems!.

### Why?

Modern location-guessing AI is impressive — but often locked behind paywalls, closed datasets, and proprietary models. We believe in **transparency**, **education**, and **collaboration**.

Together, we can build a smarter, more transparent tool that:

* Predicts the location of any photo using AI
* Learns from street signs, language, vegetation, and architecture
* Competes with the best proprietary models
* Runs on open models (like CLIP, ViT, and FAISS)
* Is 100% free and community-driven

### Project Goals

* High-accuracy geolocation from images using CLIP + KNN + heuristics
* Community-contributed, geographically diverse datasets
* Modular design (easy to extend with OCR, terrain, etc.)
* Intuitive frontend and open API
* Fully documented and reproducible

### Who Can Help?

* Machine learning engineers (CLIP, ViT, indexing)
* Full-stack developers (FastAPI, Streamlit, React)
* Data engineers (image preprocessing, dataset building)
* Geospatial experts
* Designers, writers, and testers

### How to Get Involved

1. **Star and fork the repo** (coming soon)
2. **Join the discussion** in GitHub Issues or Discord
3. **Pick an area to contribute** (code, data, docs)
4. **Build something awesome with us**

### Working Project Name

We’re currently naming it **Locatera** (open to suggestions). The idea is simple: a world-class AI that can *see* and *guess* where you are.

## Objective

Develop an AI-powered web application that predicts the geographic location (country, city, or coordinates) of an image, primarily from street-level or landscape photos.

---

Here’s a concise and compelling **public call-to-action** you can use to launch or promote your open-source AI-powered GeoGuesser alternative. You can post this on GitHub, Reddit, Twitter/X, or your project's README:

## 1. Technology Stack

### Backend

* **Language**: Python 3.10+
* **Image Embedding**: OpenAI CLIP (ViT-B/32 or ViT-L/14)
* **Vector Search**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
* **OCR (optional)**: EasyOCR or Tesseract
* **API Framework**: FastAPI or Flask
* **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite (for image metadata and logs)
* **Deployment**: Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or local Docker

### Frontend

* **Web Framework**: Streamlit (for rapid prototyping) or React (for production)
* **UI Features**:

  * Image upload
  * Location prediction display
  * Visualization on an interactive map (e.g., Leaflet.js or Mapbox)
  * User feedback form

---

## 2. Dataset Requirements

### Image Sources

* Mapillary (open, street-level imagery with GPS)
* OpenStreetCam
* GeoGuessr screenshots (manually or via YouTube scrapers)
* Custom images (e.g., user-submitted or mobile photos)

### Data Structure per Image

* Image file
* Latitude and longitude
* Country and city (from reverse geocoding)
* Timestamp (optional)
* Orientation or heading (if available)
* Extracted features (e.g., text via OCR, landmarks)

---

## 3. System Architecture

### Backend Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**: Normalize and resize all dataset images.
2. **Embedding**: Use CLIP to convert images into 512-dimensional vectors.
3. **Indexing**: Store vectors in a FAISS index with metadata references.
4. **Inference Pipeline**:

   * Accept image input via API
   * Embed using the same CLIP model
   * Query FAISS for top-N similar vectors
   * Aggregate predictions from metadata
5. **Post-processing**:

   * Country/city voting from neighbors
   * Optional OCR-based refinement (text or language clues)
6. **API Output**:

   * Predicted location (country, city, lat/lon)
   * Top-N similar matches and distances
   * Confidence score or distance error estimate

### Frontend Workflow

1. User uploads image via web interface.
2. Image is sent to the backend API.
3. Location prediction is returned and displayed.
4. Display results:

   * Predicted location and alternatives
   * Show nearest matching image examples
   * Visualize on interactive map
5. Optional: Accept user feedback ("correct" or "wrong").

---

## 4. Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP

* Collect a sample dataset (e.g., 10k–20k images with GPS)
* Build image embedding pipeline using CLIP
* Build FAISS-based search index
* Create a simple Streamlit UI to upload and predict
* Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces or locally

### Phase 2: Accuracy Improvement

* Add OCR and detect street signs or text regions
* Perform language detection to narrow down countries
* Integrate terrain/vegetation recognition for regional hints
* Fine-tune result aggregation (weighted voting, metadata filtering)

### Phase 3: Scalability and Productionization

* Use disk-based FAISS index for large datasets
* Switch frontend to React for full control and flexibility
* Use asynchronous APIs with FastAPI and image queuing (Celery or Redis)
* Deploy backend and frontend on Render or AWS
* Add map visualization (Mapbox or Leaflet.js)
* Implement analytics and logging

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

* **Top-1 Country Accuracy**: Percentage of correct country predictions
* **Top-5 City Accuracy**: Whether actual city is among top-5 neighbors
* **Mean Distance Error**: In kilometers between predicted and actual GPS
* **Inference Latency**: Response time per image
